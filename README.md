    What is Aloha?

Aloha is a static website created for RED Academy's Full-Time Web Development course for the 2018 winter cohort. (this one is by Eric Chan)



    What did we use?

For this Aloha project, we utilized HTML and CSS using modern day methods such as semantic HTML and flex-box for CSS. We also used jQuery for the behavior layer for the smooth scrolling and flickity for the carousel. 



    What did I learn?

For personal learning, I learned how to use javascript and how to properly navigate the DOM. This allowed me to learn jQuery which was easy to use once the syntax was learned, and allowed much smaller lines of code than javascript itself.
